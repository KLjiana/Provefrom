# Provefrom
Provefrom embarks on an epic journey, a thrilling and exhilarating MMORPG-Styled modpack for Minecraft 1.16.5. Designed to deliver a massive and authentic journey to every adventurer. Take on perilous dungeons and exotic dimensions. Battle various bosses. Or build your dream cottage in stylized biomes after the battles. Provefrom includes an abundance of leisure mods, ensuring everyone finds their own unique plesure and engagement throughout the journey.

## ⭐A MMORPG-inspired Forging System

In Provefrom, there are three types of weapons that can be forged: stabbing, slashing and blunt weapons. Each type of weapon has its unique characteristics and can only be obtained through adventuring, instead of magically forged from workbench.

Just like in MMORPGs, weapons can be enhanced using specific materials. You can either boost the stats or end up with scrap —it's all about luck.

## ⭐Timely Increased Intensity and Attribute Allocation:

Provefrom introduces "Improved Mobs," meaning the mobs will evolve and get deadlier over time. “Enhanced AI” also amplify the aggression of mobs, making adventures more challenging and threatening.

To counteract these dangers, we offered an attribute point based system. By absorbing experience, players can enhance their abilities by assigning points to various skills, better preparing themselves for upcoming challenges.

 
## ⭐Accessories and Enchantments:


Players have access to nearly 100 different accessories atm. You might need to carefully allocate these accessories across slots to balance their combat capabilities and special effects.


Also, there are over 200 enchantments available, with no limit on levels! You can absolutely forge a sword with Knockback C, when wipe those mobs out!


## ⭐Peace and Nature:

Beyond the perils and challenges of the journey, adventurers can find a slice of tranquility for themselves. Mods like Farmer's Delight and Drink Beer etc. can significantly enrich players' leisure activities, then decorate your base with furnishings mods. These mods will adding vibrant colors to the expeditions. So you can sit back and enjoy farming at anytime!
